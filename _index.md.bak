        <p>Hi, I'm a student worker, passionate science and technology.</p>
        <p>I'm studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna,
        I attended Information and Communications Engineering at University of
        Trento, and I'm working part-time as sysadmin/developer/IT help desk for a
        small company. In my free time I usually listen a lot of music, read tecnical
        articles, novels and comics and I experiment with single board computers, the
        linux ecosystem in general, and with ham radio stuff
        </p>
